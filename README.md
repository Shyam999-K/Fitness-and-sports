                             CALORIE TRACKER
A calorie tracker is a tool that can help you monitor and track your daily caloric intake. It works by allowing you to input the foods you eat throughout the day and calculates the number of calories in each item. By tracking your caloric intake, you can gain a better understanding of the types of foods you are consuming and how much you are eating.
To use a calorie tracker, you typically start by setting a daily caloric goal based on factors such as your age, gender, weight, and activity level. Once you have set your goal, you can begin inputting the foods you eat throughout the day. Many calorie trackers come with preloaded databases of common foods and their calorie counts, making it easy to find and input the foods you are eating.
